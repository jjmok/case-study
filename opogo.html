    <h1 class="display-2">Improving the Job Search Experience for Supplies</h1>
    <p>October 2020 - December 2020</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Overview</h2>

    <p>In October 2020, I've joined an online UI/UX class organized by <a target=”_blank” href="https://experiencehaus.com/">Experience Haus</a> in the UK. As part of the course, I was provided the opportunity to work together with a real client, Opogo. They are a Social Enterprise that brings together technology and expertise to help support educators and schools.</p>

    <p>There are 12 participants and we are grouped into 4 teams. Each team will be carrying out their research and proposing their solutions</p>

    <h2 class="h4">A brief look at UK's education sector</h2>

    <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
      <em>"81% of educators are considering leaving the profession in the previous 12 months because of workload pressures"</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is a very high demand for teachers in the UK and there are various recruitment agencies that serve to fill this gap. However, hiring teachers can be a very costly matter. Some schools had reportedly paid up to £11,000 in finder's fees to recruit teachers, making the hiring process very costly for both schools and educators. </p>

    <p>Teacher retention was poor. Educators had been leaving the profession due to workload pressure and a stressful working environment. At the time of writing, this situation had been exacerbated by the 2020 COVID pandemic. Overseas teachers can't travel abroad and this leads to a drop in potential teachers.</p>

    <p> Opogo is among one of the education platforms out there which aims not only to help schools save costs but to also find solutions to improve retention</p>
    
    <h2 class="h4">Users and Audience</h2>
    <p>Opogo's main user base is supply teachers and schools. While teachers use the Opogo app on mobile to look for jobs, the schools play a more active role in looking for teachers via the Desktop app.</p> 

    <p>Teachers firstly go through a compliance process in which they upload their credentials to be verified by the Opogo team. Verified teachers will be able to pick the time and date they are available for work and also set the distance they can travel. On the other end, Cover Managers will be able to scout, hire and manage their talents all on their talent pool in the desktop app.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, Opogo also has a thriving community of teachers who shares their learning and inspire each other. </p>

    <h2 class="h4">The Design Challenge</h2>
    
    <p>Opogo was interested in improving the user experience for their current app before developing the platform further. In the provided design brief, we were required to review the following flows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The onboarding flow for a new teacher when they sign up in the Opogo App</li>
      <li>the daily supply booking flow for the School Platform & the Opogo App </li>
    </ul>

    <p> While these are the main requests, we'll also be looking to point out other potential areas of improvement. We approach this challenge with the guidance of the Double Diamond Process</p>

    <h2 class="h4">My role in this Project</h2>
    <p>In this course, I work together with another 2 students from different backgrounds. We conducted our interviews and research together to form the 3 problem statements. Each of us picked one of the issues to work on individually, and finally presenting all 3 solutions in a single flow.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Scope and Constraints</h2>
    <p> As this is a learning course, there's a lack of time to go through every process thoroughly and this leads to several outcomes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Over the 8-week course, we can only interview 6 users. Hence the personas are formed from a small set of data and might not be a fully accurate presentation of Opogo Users.</li>
      <li>The solution we provided is designed mainly with one persona in mind.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="display-4">Discover</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Stakeholder Interview</h2>
    <p>Firstly, we had an interview with Opogo's CEO, Justyn. This interview yielded several insights that are helpful for us to get started on the project:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo's solution is geared towards a social cause that is by investing their profits back into retention & creating a social impact through community.</li>
      <li>They are looking at building up a talent pool and creating a more engaging community among educators.</li>
      <li>Online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Linkedin are considered to be either be too hostile or too generic for discussions. This drives the need to create a safe space for teachers to share and learn through the community. </li>
      <li>The current compliance process teachers went through to get verified can get unwieldy and it doesn't feel like a two-click process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h4">Competitors</h2>
    <p>Opogo is not the only app out there that's trying to tackle this issue. Apps such as Zen Educate, Engage Education, SickCover were also competing in the same field. While these aforementioned apps shared certain similarities with Opogo. We are more interested in what sets them apart</p>

    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/competitive-research.jpg" alt="competitive-research">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Engage Education</strong> - iDay provides overseas teachers and all-expenses-paid week-long trips where you get to meet and interview with multiple schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supply Clouds</strong> - Gamification - Teachers can earn points and badges which can be used to claim prizes. This
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Teacherise</strong> - Feedback Loop - Teachers can provide feedback about the school and teaching experience
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not all of these are applicable suggestions for Opogo as they have a different mission, it nonetheless does provides ideas on how Opogo can expand their services</p>

    <h2 class="display-4">Define</h2>
    <p>During this phase, we were introduced to various UX processes, each of them serves a specific need and we were encouraged to try all of them out to learn and explore what each tool does best.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - Formulating Questions</h2>
    <p>Opogo has developed its own set of user personas but it has been a while since it was updated. We started off our research by asking scoped questions to get details on specific areas. This includes the teacher's background, struggles, motivations, and how we can help them. Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Can you tell me more about your work as a teacher? How long have you been working?</li>
      <li>Tell me about the last time you tried to look for a role in education?</li>
      <li>How does the recent pandemic affect your line of work and your livelihood?</li>
      <li>Have you used any other recruitment agencies? How have you found them compared to Opogo?</li>
      <li>What motivates you to become a teacher?</li>
      <li>What struggles do you faced when you are using the Opogo app?</li>
      <li>What do you think Opogo can improve on?</li>
      <li>Do you have a form of community where you can upskill and discuss topics? </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In one of our classes, we held our first user interview with 2 Opogo users. They were interviewed by 2 students in our class while we take notes. Apart from that, Our team also conducted our interviews with a few more teachers to form a better picture of our user personas.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas</h2>
    <div class="d-flex">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500 mr-3" src="img/personas.png" alt="personas">
      <p>For each interviewee, we present their feedbacks in the structure shown on the image. With more information gathered from different interviewees, we'll be able to see trends or common behaviors that will help us to form our Personas</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - Empathy Maps</h2>
    <div class="d-flex">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500 mr-3" src="img/empathy-map.png" alt="empathy-map">
      <div>
        <p>
          We also created an empathy map that puts ourselves in the shoes of the teachers
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach makes us think about the possible experiences of a supply teacher. Giving us insights on how we could design solutions that are tailored to their needs
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      More examples can be found in this <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/experiencehaus6726/m/experiencehaus6726/1605303599763/251f08f544e2ba9943056dc2ac117293a80e4290">Mural Link</a>
    </div>

    <h2 class="h4">Forming Personas - the 3 personas</h2>

    <p>The previous maps paint a common behavioral pattern among our interviewees, and this leads to the formulation of 3 personas.</p>

    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="img/persona1.jpg" alt="persona1">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="img/persona2.jpg" alt="persona2">
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-700 mb-2" src="img/persona3.jpg" alt="persona3">
    </div>

    <p>Due to the interest of time, we decided to form our solution based on 1 persona: The Rep for Temps AKA the temporary supply teacher. This is because our team kept in touch with a teacher from the user interview that fits this role. She's also open  to participating upcoming interviews and user tests.</p>

    <p>As opposed to a permanent teacher, temporary supplies are teachers whom are generally on the move. They valued the flexibility offered by a temporary position. During this short stint before they relocate, they are looking for a temporary role to fill in to get more income.</p>
  
    <h2 class="h4">User Journey - Task Analysis</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>
        Next, we took a deeper look into the journey of our persona and how she goes through a journey to look for a job to gain a better understanding of the flow that she went through. This approach focuses more on the tasks that a teacher might do at a specific stage of their journey.
      </p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/task-analysis.png" alt="task-analysis">
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="h4">User Journey - Experience Map</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>
        Apart from that, we also tried another approach to understand our persona's journey better. This method explores the user journey on a more empathetic level.
      </p>
      <p>From this map, there are a few low points, but the one that stood out to us was the last one. Teachers feels anxious on their first day to school.</p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/experience-map.png" alt="experience-map">
    </div>
  
    <h2>User Stories</h2>
    
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p>Based on experience maps and our user interviews, we started to form user stories. Each of them focuses on a problem our persona is trying to solve and when do they need it solved. </p>
      <p>It's generally framed in the following method:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
        As a _(user)_, I would like to __ (action)___ so that I can __ (what is success?)___.
      </blockquote>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/user-stories.png" alt="user-stories">
    </div>

    <h2>Job Stories</h2>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column">
      <p> We also explore another option with the Jobs-to-be-done framework. This reframes our perspective on the issue and prompts us to think about what causes teachers to use Opogo in the first place. How does it enable our teachers to perform their jobs?</p>
      <p>It's framed as the following:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
        When __(trigger) __ , I want to __ (action)___ , so I can __ (success criteria)___
      </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/job-stories.png" alt="job-stories">
    </div>
    

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>We eventually form problems in these 3 areas.</p>

    <h5 class="text-success">School Communication</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The Opogo app can help teachers by providing more information about the school because teachers are feeling more anxious the less they know about the school</li>
      <li>Opogo needs to have a point of contact readily available for the teacher because the teacher will be able to ask questions about the school and will have a person she knows at the school to better orientate themselves.</li>
      <li>Opogo app needs a better way to help teachers to get settled in schools as they don't feel welcome when they arrive at a school. This will put the teacher at ease and make them feel welcome at the school.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-info">Search Filter</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo needs to include a deeper set of filters for what the teacher is experienced in. This will enable them to show the schools a better understanding of what they specialize in. </li>
      <li>the Opogo app needs a way to adjust levels of expertise because  all teachers have differing levels in subjects and expertise levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-warning">Community</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo needs a way to improve the way users use the community platform because these said users have a glance and never stay on there. By making the app more interactive or based on teacher's needs it will allow them to use the community app.</li>
      <li>Opogo need a way to connect teachers because supply teachers often feel left out of the loop and eventually feel isolated  </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Misc Problems</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo app needs a way to check up on long-term supply teachers to see how they are getting on at the schools. This will therefore retain these teachers on the Opogo app.</li>
      <li>The Opogo website needs to be much more discoverable on the search engine when we search for supply teacher because a lot of teachers looking for a role in supply teaching won't discover it</li>
      <li>Opogo needs a way to be more accommodating to teachers who don't know the London area because people who have just arrived in the city  will feel disorientated and will not know the different areas.</li>
      <li>The Opogo app needs to show teachers feedbacks from their students because teachers aren't sure how well they are performing</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="display-4">Develop</h2>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>From the problems above, we have formed 3 hypothesis </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="text-info">Search Filter</strong> — We believe that by expanding the job search filters, for both teachers and school, we will display better matches for both parties but also increase the level of confidence in the platform, we will know this to be true when we see more compatible matches and an increase of the number of bookings</li>
      <li><strong class="text-success">School Communication</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers and schools to share essential information before the teacher arrives. Teachers will feel much supported when they arrived at the school on their first day. We will know this to be true when we get positive feedback from teachers in regards to orientation at new schools </li>
      <li><strong class="text-warning">Community</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers to connect directly with each other through (method), we will create a more engaged and supportive community, We will know this to be true when we see consistent growth in the MAU</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ideation & Storyboarding</h2>
    <p>We create several ideas</p>

    <h5>School Communication (Storyboard)</h5>
