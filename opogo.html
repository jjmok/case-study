    <h1 class="display-4">Improving the Job Search Experience for Supplies</h1>
    <h1 class="display-4">Finding the right role</h1>
    <p>October 2020 - December 2020</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Introduction</h2>

    <p>In October 2020, I've join an online UI/UX class organized by <a target=”_blank” href="https://experiencehaus.com/">Experience Haus</a> in UK. As part of the course, I was provided the opportunity to work together with a real client, Opogo. They are a Social Enterprise that brings together technology and expertise to help support educators and schools.

    </p>

    <h2 class="h4">A brief look at UK's education sector</h2>

    <blockquote class="blockquote bg-primary text-white p-4 italic">
      <em>"81% of educators are considering leaving the profession in the previous 12 months because of workload pressures"</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>There is a very high demand for teachers in the UK and there are various recruitment agencies that serves to fill this gap. However, hiring teachers can be a very costly matter. Some schools had reportedly paid up to £11,000 in finder's fees to recruit teachers, making the hiring process very costly for both school and educators. </p>

    <p>Teacher retention was poor. Educators had been leaving the profession due to workload pressure and stressful working environment. At the time of writing, this situation had been exacerbated by the 2020 COVID pandemic. Overseas teachers can't travel abroad and this leads to a drop in potential teachers.</p>

    <p> Opogo is among one of the education platforms out there which aims not only to help schools save costs but to also find solutions to improve retention</p>
    
    <h2 class="h4">The Design Challenge</h2>
    <p>Opogo was interested in improving the user experience for their current app before developing the platform further. In the design brief, we were tasked to review the following flows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The onboarding flow for a new teacher when they sign up in the Opogo App</li>
      <li>the daily supply booking flow for the School Platform & the Opogo App </li>
    </ul>

  
    <h2 class="h4">Users and audience</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Roles and responsibilities</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Scope and constraints</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Process and what you did</h2>
    
    <h2 class="h4">Outcomes and lessons</h2>

    <h2 class="h4">Introduction</h2>
    
    
  
    
    <h1 class="display-4">Problem Space - Discover</h1>
    <p>The Double Diamond process was utilized to uncover problems and also to form solutions</p>
    <p>We began by conducting a Stakeholder Interview, doing competitive research and also User Interviews. </p>

    <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
    <p>Opogo's competitors share certain common features with Opogo but we are more interested in what sets them apart. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Engage Education</strong> - iDay provides overseas teachers and all-expenses-paid week-long trip where you get to meet and interview with multiple schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supply Clouds</strong> - Gamifications - Teachers can earn points and badges which can be use to claim prizes. This
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Teacherise</strong> - Feedback Loop - Teachers can provide feedback about the school and teaching experience
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not all of these are applicable suggestions for Opogo as they have a different mission, it nonetheless does provides ideas on how Opogo can expand their services</p>

    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      While Opogo already had created their own User Personas from their research, it's been awhile since it was updated. We interviewed teachers that used Opogo, and also non-users to get a better sense of our target users.

    <h2>Forming User Personas</h2>

    <p>From the interviews, we noted down several aspects of the interviewees that would help us to form our Personas</p>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid img-500" src="img/personas.png" alt="personas">

    <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
    <p>We also created an empathy map which puts us into the shoes of our interviewees, which helps us to understand what they go through on a daily basis</p>

    <h2>Job Stories</h2>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>We eventually form problems in these 3 areas.</p>

    <h5 class="text-success">School Communication</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The Opogo app can help teachers by providing more information about the school because teachers are feeling more anxious the less they know about the school</li>
      <li>Opogo needs to have a point of contact readily available for the teacher because, the teacher will be able to ask questions pertaining to the school and will have a person she knows at the school  to better orientate themselves .</li>
      <li>Opogo app needs a better way to help teachers to get settled in schools as they don't feel welcome when they arrive at a school. This will put the teacher at ease and make them feel welcome at the school.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-info">Search Filter</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo needs to include a deeper set of filters for what the teacher is experienced in. This will enable them to show the schools a better understanding of what they specialise in. </li>
      <li>the opogo app needs a way adjust levels of expertise because  all teachers have differing levels in subjects and expertise levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-warning">Community</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo needs a way to improve the way users use the community platform because these said users have a glance and never stay on there. By making the app more interactive or based on teachers needs it will allow them to use the community app.</li>
      <li>Opogo need a way to connect teachers with each other because supply teachers often feel left out of the loop and eventually feel isolated  </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Misc Problems</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Opogo app needs a way to check up on long term supply teachers to see how they are getting on at the schools. This will therefore retain these teachers on the Opogo app.</li>
      <li>The Opogo website needs to be much more discoverable on the search engine when we search for supply teacher because a lot of teachers looking for a role in supply teaching won't discover it</li>
      <li>opogo needs a way to be more accommodating to teacher who don't know the London area because people who have just arrived into the city  will feel diorientated and will not know the different areas.</li>
      <li>The Opogo app needs to show teachers feedbacks from their students because teachers aren't sure how well they are performing</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2 class="display-4">Solution Space - Develop</h2>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>From the problems above, we have formed 3 hypothesis </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong class="text-info">Search Filter</strong> — We believe that by expanding the job search filters, for both teachers and school, we will display better matches for both parties but also increase the level of confidence in the platform, we will know this to be true when we see more compatible matches and an increase of number of bookings</li>
      <li><strong class="text-success">School Communication</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers and school to share essential information with each other prior to the teacher arriving. Teachers will feel much supported when they arrived at the school on their first day. We will know this to be true when we get positive feedback from teachers in regards to orientation at new schools </li>
      <li><strong class="text-warning">Community</strong> — We believe that by allowing teachers to connect directly with each other through (method), we will create a more engaged and supportive community, We will know this to be true when we see a consistent growth in the MAU</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ideation & Storyboarding</h2>
    <p>We create several ideas</p>

    <h5>School Communication (Storyboard)</h5>

    <h2 class="display-4">Solution Space - Deliver</h2>
    <h5>User Flow</h5>
    <p>From this we create the user flow</p>
    
    <p>Desktop App - Schools Searching for Teachers</p>
    <img class="border rounded img-fluid" src="img/user-flow-1.png" alt="">

    <p>Mobile App - Teachers looking for Schools</p>

    <h5>Low Fidelity</h5>

    <h5>Usability Feedback</h5>
    <blockquote>“The current search results includes tags from all 3 categories. There’s no easy way to tell them apart. Perhaps a search by category function would help!”</blockquote>
