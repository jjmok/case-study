    <h1>Opogo Case Study</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>In August 2020, I've participated in an online UI/UX course organized by <a target=”_blank” href="https://experiencehaus.com/">Experience Haus</a>.</p>
    <p>I was provided the opportunity to work with real clients together in a team of 3.</p>
    <p>The aforementioned client is Opogo, they provide a service that connects both supply teachers and schools in the UK </p>
  
    <h2>A brief look into the problem</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>While the UK Government has spent quite a lot on supply, but some of their approaches are archaic and ineffective</li>
      <li>There’s also a problem with Poor Teacher Retention. Teachers are leaving the profession due to various reasons such as workload pressure and stressful working environment.</li>
      <li>And the situation has been exacerbated by the recent COVID situation. Overseas teachers can’t travel abroad, leading to a lack of teacher supply in the UK</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Design Challenge</h2>
    <p>Each team is tasked at looking at the following issues from their perspective</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Opogo app - Review the onboarding flow for a new user signing up. End-to-end.</li>
      <li>2. Schools platform & Opogo app - Review the daily supply booking flow end-to-end. (This includes the school finding an available candidate, sending a job, the candidate receiving and accepting).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>UX Process</h2>
    <p>The Double Diamond process was utilized to uncover problems and also to form solutions</p>
    <p>We began by conducting a Stakeholder Interview, doing competitive research and also User Interviews. </p>

    <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
    <p>Opogo's competitors share certain common features with Opogo but we are more interested in what sets them apart. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Engage Education - iDay provides overseas teachers and all-expenses-paid week-long trip where you get to meet and interview with multiple schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supply Clouds - Gamifications - Teachers can earn points and badges which can be use to claim prizes. This
      </li>
      <li>
        Teacherise - Feedback Loop - Teachers can provide feedback about the school and teaching experience
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not all of these are applicable suggestions for Opogo as they have a different mission, it nonetheless does provides ideas on how Opogo can expand their services</p>

    <h2>User Interviews</h2>
    <p>
      While Opogo already had created their own User Personas from their research, it's been awhile since it was updated. 
      We interviewed teachers that used Opogo, and also non-users to get a better sense of our target users.
    </p>
    <p>We are genera</p>
    <p>Questions</p>
